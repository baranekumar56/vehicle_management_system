what are the things that this service could offer

--> it should compute available hours with date for each user, based on their service time

--> it should carry out the scheduling daily or immediate schedule call when halt/block/reject/booking/completed
    most of the time , the invocation states will be handled in the fastapi server

--> the main thing is the communication is part

--> what is the efficient message type that could help me , tell which booking affected and what to do next ?


fields in msg:

    --> booking id, current status, mechanic id, schedule_id(may or may not come)
    --> msg for getting available hours, hour span in array format(9, 10, 11, 12), that's it
